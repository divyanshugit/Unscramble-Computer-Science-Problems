# Unscramble-Computer-Science-Problems
In this project, five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged. I used Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset . Lastly, I performed the run time analysis of the solution and its efficiency.

# Idea:
This project is inspired from a project of Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms.
